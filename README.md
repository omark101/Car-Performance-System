# Data Collection Phase

## Overview

The data collection phase of this project was a collaborative effort involving multiple team members working diligently to gather, clean, and prepare a comprehensive dataset. This dataset serves as the foundation for our subsequent analyses and models. It's important to note that during this phase, we focused solely on gathering data and did not make any changes to the dataset.
